When we called the vet to schedule euthanasia it didn't seem final - she might still turn around, there might be a change, we might try different medication. It was a day away and that felt like plenty of time and that we would call her when Rufus started eating again and say "no need to come, she's getting better, our cat is fine."

Kelsey brought her home after work, this tiny ferocious cat. She got her from a person who had an entire litter of kittens that she needed to give away and there was no adoption fee or shelter involved, just a hand off near the post office - "here you go, here's a cat." She took her home to our apartment and a few days later we were yelled at by our landlord who was having a bad day - a bad life, really - and we MAYBE? considered giving her up for just the briefest moment but probably not and that cat was here to stay and we would sooner move than give up our kitten. That landlord was and is a jerk. Fuck you for yelling at a 21 year old with a kitten.

She moved with us to Wickford, into an apartment that was barely big enough for one person let alone two and a cat.

We shared our food, our bed, everything with this cat and I hesitate to anthropomorphize her but she'd chirp and meow to us to indicate what she wanted and we understood every sound and movement of her body. We knew when she was happy, scared, hungry, when she wanted a little more room on the couch or to be wrapped up in a blanket, when she wanted to play -- everything.

I've almost always had a cat in some form and the same is true for Kelsey. We had childhood cats and young adult cats and cats we'd visit at home when we had moved out. Rufus was our very first cat that belong to us and that we were solely responsible for. When she got sick, it was agony, even if it was a minor cold. She had a stomach thing and we didn't have a carrier and Kelsey brought her to the vet in a cardboard box - please, just help my cat, she's sick. I think it went away on its own, no intervention needed, just a mystery cat stomach bug.

We moved to Kelsey's parents. We got married.

We bought a house and moved to South Kingstown.

We had two kids. Rufus loved them and Rufus loved us and they loved Rufus. Rufus _did not love most people_. She was incredibly protective and kind of anti-social and would trick people into petting her - she'd act like she wanted attention, rub against their legs, then bite and scratch them if they pet her. She wanted everything on her own terms. She once cornered a friend of ours in the basement - I had gone outside to shoo away a cat that was Rufus was hissing at through the window and, all worked up, Rufus redirect her anger.

She seemed like she'd live forever. She jumped on the bookshelf and ran around, gently smacking our hands away when we'd try to get her down. She chased lasers up door frames. She sat in our kids laps and slept in their beds.
